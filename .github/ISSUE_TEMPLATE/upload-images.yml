        Where should the images be saved?
        - For EMP events → use `assets/img/EMP/`
        - For partner logos → use `assets/img/partners/`
        - For general images → use `assets/img/`
        
        ⚠️ **Important**: The path and filename must match exactly what you use in your YAML/Markdown files!

        **Step 1**: Drag or paste your image files into this text box below.
        **Step 2**: GitHub will automatically convert them to Markdown format: `![image](https://github.com/...)`
        **Step 3**: Change the `image` part (between `![` and `]`) to your desired filename.
        
        Example:
        - `![EMP-A-2026](https://...)` → saves as `EMP-A-2026.jpg`
        - `![partner-logo](https://...)` → saves as `partner-logo.png`
      placeholder: |
        ![my-filename](https://github.com/user-attachments/...)
        ![another-image](https://github.com/user-attachments/...)

        ## 📋 How it works:
        
        **Where images go:**
        - Images will be saved to the **Target Path** you specified above
        - For EMP event images → use `assets/img/EMP/`
        - For partner logos → use `assets/img/partners/`
        - For general images → use `assets/img/`
        
        **How to name your files:**
        1. Upload/paste your image → GitHub creates: `![image](https://...)`
        2. Change `image` to your desired name → `![EMP-A-2026](https://...)`
        3. Submit the issue → File saved as: `EMP-A-2026.jpg`
        
        **Important:**
        - The filename in `![filename]` will be used exactly (special characters → underscores)
        - File extension is added automatically based on image type
        - If a file with the same name exists, a number suffix will be added (e.g., `file_1.jpg`)
        
        **⚠️ Critical**: Your path and filename must match exactly what you reference in your code:
        - If your YAML has `image: "../assets/img/EMP/EMP-A-2026.jpg"`
        - Then use path `assets/img/EMP/` and filename `![EMP-A-2026](https://...)`
